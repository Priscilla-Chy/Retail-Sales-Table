# Retail Sales Table

## Objective
The objective of this project was to organise and analyse a retail sales dataset using basic Microsoft Excel features. The task focused on structuring raw data, applying filters, and calculating key summary metrics to support simple business insights.

## Dataset
The dataset contains retail sales information, including customer age, product details, sales values, and commission amounts. The data was provided in a raw format and required structuring before analysis.

## Key Tasks Performed
- Converted the data in columns A–H into a structured Excel table
- Applied filtering to sort the Age column from largest to smallest
- Calculated the total commission using the SUM function in cell P10
- Calculated the average commission using the AVERAGE function in cell P11
- Verified calculations for accuracy and clarity

## Tools & Functions Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Excel Tables  
- Filters and Sorting  
- SUM function  
- AVERAGE function  

## Screenshots
Screenshots are included to demonstrate:
- Conversion of raw data into an Excel table  
- Filtering of the Age column  
- Commission total calculation  
- Average commission calculation  

## Key Takeaways
- Developed an understanding of how Excel tables improve data structure, consistency, and ease of analysis  
- Applied basic Excel formulas (SUM and AVERAGE) to calculate key sales performance metrics  
- Learned how sorting and filtering data supports quick identification of trends and patterns  

## Reflective Practice
This project highlighted the importance of preparing and structuring data before carrying out any analysis. Converting the dataset into an Excel table significantly improved accuracy when applying formulas and filters, reducing the risk of errors.

Working through this task reinforced how even simple calculations, such as total and average commission, can provide meaningful insights into sales performance when applied correctly. If I were to extend this project, I would incorporate visualisations such as charts to improve how insights are communicated to stakeholders and support quicker decision-making.
